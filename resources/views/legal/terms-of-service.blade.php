                    Customers wishing to travel with pets <strong>must inform AeroTAXI at the time of booking</strong>. Failure to do so may result in the supplier refusing to carry the animal, and no refund will be given in such circumstances.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    All pets must travel in a suitable <strong>pet carrier</strong> that is secure and appropriate for the size of the animal. Service animals (e.g., guide dogs) are exempt from the carrier requirement but must still be declared at the time of booking.

                    We recommend that customers allow sufficient time for their journey. As a general guideline, passengers should aim to arrive at the airport at least <strong>2 hours before</strong> a domestic flight and <strong>3 hours before</strong> an international flight.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    If the luggage exceeds the capacity of the booked vehicle, the supplier may be unable to transport all items, and AeroTAXI shall not be liable in such cases.
